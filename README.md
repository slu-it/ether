# Social Media Platform: Ether

A social media platform (think Twitter/Bluesky), where you post "screms" (into the ether ..).
A "scream" (analog a tweet / post etc.) will automatically be deleted after 24h, no way around it.

Interactions with "screams":

- like & dislike, but actual number are only visible to the "scream" author
- commenting in some way shape of form?
- "re-scream"?

Users can follow other users and see their "screams" in the Ether.
Hashtag-based topic screaming is possible in order to find "screams" about specific things easier.
